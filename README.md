# ISO 14812 _Intelligent Transport Systems - Vocabulary_
This repository is provided to promote the collaborative development of terminology for the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) community. The work is led by ISO/TC 204/WG 1, but we are interested in receiving input from the full ITS community so that the end result is a resource that will be widely used and accepted.

The process used by this effort conforms to ISO 704:2009, which can be summarized as:
1. Select the field (in our case ITS)
2. Analyse the intension (i.e., characteristics) and extension (i.e., resulting set of objects) of each concept
3. Determine the concept's relationships to other concepts
4. Illustrate relationships with a concept diagram
5. Formulate definitions based on relationships
6. Assign a designation (i.e., the term) to each concept

The process also conforms to ISO 24156-1:2014, which defines how to use UML to illustrate relationships with a concept diagram (Step 4 above). The UML diagrams are created and maintained using [Sparx Enterprise Architect](https://www.sparxsystems.com/products/ea/index.html) and published using XMI so that they can be imported into any number of different tools. The pubished XMI file is [14812.xml](../../raw/master/14812.xml).

The material found on this site is work in progress. ISO 14812 is has not yet been sent to ballot and all content is subject to change.

The model can be viewed three ways:
1. [Viewing the website here](https://k-vaughn.github.io/iso14812/)
2. Downloading the 14812.eap file and loading into Enterprise Architect 14
3. Downloading the 14812.xml file and importing into any tool that supports XMI 2.1
